# Notion Table => Blog

```bash
npm install notion-table-to-blog --save-dev
npx notion-table-to-blog
```
## Why this tool ?
- I like Notion. I jot down whatever I learn there.
- I want to share my leanings with the world but I want to choose the way

## Why Markdown ? 
- All static site generators integrate well with it.
- No dependency on Notion. All your posts stays in your repo if you need to say bye to Notion.

## How it works ?
1. Write in Notion. Use [this](https://hariombalhara.notion.site/99fd5a455d8e4dd981176fc6dbc74f33?v=25c9813976174e92a08e9ffd615714b1) template to start.
2. Run this command manually or better set it up with your CI to run every few mins.
3. You will get the Posts as markdown.
4. Use those markdowns the way you want.

## Status
I use this tool to publish my [blog](http://hariombalhara.in/). So, it has features that are required by me. But it is in a pretty usable shape.
